# Clinic Booking System Database
I've designed a comprehensive database management system for a clinic booking system using MySQL. This system handles appointments, patient records, medical staff, billing, and other essential clinic operations.
Database Structure
The database includes the following tables with proper relationships:
Core Tables:

patients: Stores patient personal and medical information
medical_staff: Contains doctor/staff information linked to specialties
clinic_locations: Manages multiple clinic locations
time_slots: Available appointment slots for each doctor at each location
appointments: Core booking records linking patients to time slots
medical_records: Patient medical history linked to appointments
billing: Financial records for appointments

# Supporting Tables:

specialties: Medical specializations for staff
appointment_status: Different states an appointment can be in
lab_tests: Available diagnostic tests
medications: Medication catalog
staff_locations: Many-to-many relationship showing which staff works at which locations
ordered_tests: Tests ordered during appointments
prescriptions: Medications prescribed to patients

# Key Features

# Data Integrity:

Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints throughout
NOT NULL, UNIQUE constraints where appropriate
Indexes for performance optimization


# Relationship Types:

One-to-many (doctor to appointments)
Many-to-many (staff to locations, appointments to tests)
One-to-one relationships as needed


# Advanced SQL Features:

Views for common queries
Stored procedures for booking and canceling appointments
Triggers for maintaining data consistency
Events for automatic updates
Full-text search capabilities


# Business Logic:
